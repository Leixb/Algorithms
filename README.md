# Algorithms
## About
Basic C++ Algorithms and Classes to be used for competitive programming
## Categories
- Fractions
- Geometry
- Graphs
- ... (more)

## Fractions
Contains a class fractions that manages simple fraction operations and comparations
## Geometry
Contains some classes to manage typicall geometry problems. At the moment it contains:
- vect (work with vectors(dot products, cross products...))
- line (intersec lines, find normal ...)
- polygon (on development)
- coord (on development)

## Graphs
Contains a class to manage an adjacency matrix and some basic graph algorithms. (Full functionality with non simple graphs is not yet implemented and more algorithms will be coming soon).
